    <h5>Admiration</h5>
    <p>Ralph Lauren and I grew up in the same place Bronx, New York City. As kid I used to draw lot. This was a way for me to escape the world that I was living in. I would practice on my draw skill for basically the whole day until I got tired. Eventaully I beagn to realized that I probably won't make it anywhere with this, Due to the fact that many people  in my life would bully me about my drawing. This led me to find new people that enjoyed the same things that I did. Around the age of 13, I founded one of my best friend that introduce me to Ralph Lauren the perosn not the brand. I instantly drew to him beacasue he never onced gave up on himself and he always betted on himself to get where he is now. If he didnt have the strength to convinced the presidnt of the company to give him a chance. Who knows what would have happen.</p>
